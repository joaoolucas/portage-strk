 * bottom third of a window whose top two thirds are gold and tonics. Pulling
 * it in eagerly put the whole of starknet on the game's first load; making the
 * whole window wait on it meant a click that lit the tab and then showed
 * nothing for as long as the chunk took. Deferring just the drawer gets both:
 * the counter opens at once and the drawer fills in below it.

/**
 * The trading post.
 *
 * Hunting produced two dead ends. Trophies piled up with nothing to do but be
 * dropped, and the five tonics a Porter starts with were the only five that
 * would ever exist — run out and the auto-drink simply stopped happening, with
 * no way to restock. Both ends meet here: what you hauled home turns into coin,
 * and coin turns into the supplies that keep you standing.
 *
 * Prices are the catalogue's, not a separate table. The post pays half of what
 * a thing is worth and charges all of it, which is what makes the difference
 * between a market and a bank.
 *
 * The STRK20 privacy drawer hangs off the bottom of the same window. It was
 * written before anything rendered it and was mounted into `portage/
 * Marketplace.tsx`, a component no screen reaches, so nothing in the running
 * client could ever show it. The counter is its home: this is already the tab
 * that deals in currency, and gold and STRK are the two the game has.
